# Please write a program which asks the user for a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit,
# and then prints out the same in degrees Celsius. If the converted temperature falls
# below zero degrees Celsius, the program should also print out "Brr! It's cold in here!".

# The formula for converting degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius can be found easily
# by any search engine of your choice.

# Two examples of expected behaviour:
# Please type in a temperature (F): 101
# 101 degrees Fahrenheit equals 38.333333333333336 degrees Celsius
#
# Please type in a temperature (F): 21
# 21 degrees Fahrenheit equals -6.111111111111111 degrees Celsius
# Brr! It's cold in here!

# Write your solution here
temperature_f = int(input("Please type in a temperature(F): "))

temperature_c = (temperature_f - 32) * 5 / 9

print(f"{temperature_f} degrees Fahrenheit equals {temperature_c} degrees Celsius")
